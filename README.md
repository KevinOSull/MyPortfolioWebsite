# MyPortfolioWebsite

## Introduction
"MyPortfolioWebsite" is my first assessed portfolio project. This project will showcase my skill in HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap to create
a responsive website showing projects I have done previously and showing employers my skills. This site is designed to showcase my projects and 
show potential employers what I can do.

-The hero section features a background image with overlayed introductory text, immediately introducing me as a Full Stack Developer. 
-The text is styled for readability, with clear headings and supporting paragraphs, and adjusts responsively on different screen sizes to remain legible. 
-This design guides the visitorâ€™s attention, reinforces branding, and provides a professional first impression.

## Font Choice
